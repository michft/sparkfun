This might eventually be GPLv3, but for now it is all rights reserved, but you can use it for personal use.

No (re)distribution rights.

Basically you have to own what you are using it on, and if you sell or otherwise transfer the ownership, you need to erase the code from it.

If you want to use it otherwise, contact me.  thomas@mich.com
